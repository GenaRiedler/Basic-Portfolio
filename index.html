			<h2>About Me</h2>

			<p>
				I'm fascinated by engaging experiences on the web. As a Graphic Designer and a studying Web Developer, I want others to share my fascination. I have a BS in Graphic Design from the Art Institute in San Diego. I've worked as a bookeeper and a production assistant, but currently as Lead Graphic Designer for Eagle Creek. I have 10 years of experience as a graphic designer and am excited to plunge into the sea of web development.

				At home, in Oceanside, I have an awesome husband, two adorable daughters, two playful pups, and one mellow yellow cat. I run half marathons here and there. I love tv shows. Anything and everything from Iron Chef America to Rick and Morty, I will watch it. I'm obsessed with Spotify. They make such great playlists.
